The purpose of this assignment was to become familiar with the Ohio Supercomputer, virtual machines, jupyter lab, bash, R, and python. We were required to access the Ohio supercomputer and become familiar with the ascend desktop terminal. Once we started jupyterlab with the R and Python kernels present, we were required to create notebooks for bash, R and python with commands printing "Hello, World!" Then, we could export them as scripts.
We were also required to download 3 different files to our environment for the program to use. 
Once all required files were present within the "bash_tutorial" folder, we were required to create a new GitHub Repository. Once created, we linked it to the jupyterlab folder we had been working in. This allows us to access the files through github outside of jupyterlab. Once all files had been moved and this README file had been added, we submitted the HTML file to the CarmenCanvas assignment.
